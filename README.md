# js_albums_project

A project to review API calls

### Summary

AP2 is an API sandbox using JsonPlaceholder API. This project is done with vanilla JavaScript. API calls are made through built-in Fetch API.

### Getting Started

Most of the web page are made for fun (header, footer, navbar etc.).

The main part is _API Sandbox_ part and _Get Photos Get Albums_ part

#### API Sandbox

This part has an embedded code editor to try the API calls. There are already two calls made. If you run it, you can see the result on the right section.

#### Get Photos Get Albums

Here, if you click to Get Photos, you will see first 9 photos fetched from the JsonPlaceholder API. If you click once more, you will get the next 9 photos.

Later, if you click to Get Albums, you will see the first 9 albums within the same div.

### TODO's

- Implement the whole logic also with React.
- Another call to return the photos of selected album.
- Add a Helper file to show other call examples in the embedded terminal.
