# js_albums_project

A project to review API calls
You can find the published page [on this link.](https://enginkosure.github.io/js_albums_project/)

### Summary

AP2 is an API sandbox using JsonPlaceholder. This project is done with vanilla JavaScript. For CSS, Bootstrap Library and SASS preprocessor used.
API calls are made through built-in Fetch API.

### Getting Started

Most parts of the page are made for fun (header, footer, navbar etc.).

The main part is _API Sandbox_ part and _Get Photos Get Albums_ section.

#### API Sandbox

This part has an embedded code editor to try the API calls. There are already two calls made. If you run it, you can see the result on the right section.
You can show and hide this section by means of clicking on **API SandBox ~ Try it ~ Show/Hide** button.

#### Get Photos Get Albums

Here, if you click to Get Photos button, you will see first 9 photos fetched from the JsonPlaceholder API. If you click once more, you will get the next 9 photos.

Later, if you click to Get Albums button, you will see the first 9 albums within the same div.

### TODOs

- Implement the whole logic also with React and Flask or Django.
- Another call to return the photos of selected album.
- Add a Helper file to show other call examples in the embedded terminal.
- Add Tooltip for buttons that explains the functionality.
